# Overview of Spring Boot JWT Authentication 
We will build a Spring Boot application in that:

- User can signup new account, or login with username & password.
- By Userâ€™s role (admin, moderator, user), we authorize the User to access resources

This is our Spring Boot application demo running with MySQL database and test Rest Apis with Postman.
